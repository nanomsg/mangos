|===
|_Mangos&trade;_ v2  is an implementation in pure Go of the *SP*
("`Scalability Protocols`") messaging system.
These are colloquially  known as a "`nanomsg`".

|===

NOTE: This is version 2 of _mangos_, and contains breaking changes and
rather different API in some circumstances relative to version 1.  To use the
original version of _mangos_ please see https://github.com/nanomsg/mangos-v1

The modern C implemenation of the SP protocols is available as
https://github.com/nanomsg/nng[__NNG&trade;__].

The original implementation of the SP protocols is available as
http://www.nanomsg.org[__nanomsg&trade;__].

Generally (modulo a few caveats) all of these implementations can interoperate.

The design is intended to make it easy to add new transports with almost
trivial effort, as well as new topologies ("`protocols`" in SP parlance.)

At present, all of the Req/Rep, Pub/Sub, Pair, Bus, Push/Pull, and
Surveyor/Respondent patterns are supported.
This project also supports an experimental protocol called Star.

Supported transports include TCP, inproc, IPC, WebSocket, WebSocket/TLS and TLS.
Forcing the local TCP port in Dial is not supported yet (this
is rarely useful).

Basic interoperability with nanomsg and NNG has been verified (you can do
so yourself with `nanocat` and `macat`) for all protocols and transports
that _NNG_ and _nanomsg_ support.
Additionally there are a number of projects that use the two products together.

// There is a third party experimental QUIC transport available at
// [quic-mangos](https://github.com/lthibault/quic-mangos).
// (An RFE to make this transport official exists.)

// If you find this useful, I would appreciate knowing about it.  I can be reached
// via my email address, garrett -at- damore -dot- org

== Installing

===  Using *go get*

    $ go get -u nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2

You can use `go get -u -a` to update all installed packages.

== Documentation

For docs, see https://godoc.org/nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2 or run:

    $ godoc -http=:6060

then see http://localhost:6060/pkg/nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2/

== Testing

This package supports internal self tests, which can be run in
the idiomatic Go way.
(Note that most of the tests are in a test subdirectory.)

    $ go test nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2/...

There are also internal benchmarks available:

    $ go test -bench=. nanomsg.org/go/mangos/v2/test

## Commercial Support

mailto:info@staysail.tech[Staysail Systems, Inc.] offers
http://staysail.tech/support/mangos[commercial support] for mangos.

## Examples

Some examples are posted in the directories under `examples/` in this project.

These examples are rewrites (in Go) of Tim Dysinger's
http://nanomsg.org/gettingstarted/index.html[Getting Started with Nanomsg].

Running `godoc` in the example directories will yield information about how
to run each example program.

Enjoy!
